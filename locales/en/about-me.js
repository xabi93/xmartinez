    `
    I'm Software Developer, mainly focused on backend development, but I
    dont discard any opportunity to learn and work with new tools. About
    my personality, I'm an ambitious developer, always looking for new
    challenges. I also love work in team.

    I spend my free time between learning new things to improve my self as
    developer, and doing sport, as it gives me the opportunity to beat
    myself.
